# Arch Install Script

Just a BASH script to install Arch Linux with a bunch of customizations. These script will install the system with LUKS, BTRFS, systemd-boot and UKI kernel.

At the top of this script, you will find a timer (to set the script run in idle time for better internet connection) and variables for set a custom username, password and hostname. By default, **root account will be disabled**. The script can be configured to reboot, poweroff or just output a successful message.

## How to use

To use the script, run:

```bash
# TODO
```

This command will copy the script to a Live CD Arch Linux media. Then, edit the variables at the top of document and run it later:

```bash
# vim script.sh
# bash script.sh
```
